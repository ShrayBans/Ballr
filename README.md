# Ballr

Ballr is an NBA comparison tool that takes the top 100 basketball players stats (scraped from www.basketball-reference.com) and allows users to compare them. Ballr assigns a specific "Ballr" score to each player and chooses the best amongst the given and displays it.

##Usage

Currently Ballr is [DEPLOYED](https://nba-ballr.herokuapp.com/), but for now please enjoy it through:

<i>Be sure to try **STEPHEN CURRY** for a special Ballr score</i>

##Tech Stack
- **React** (using Redux as a global state container)
- Experimented with both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** (can be interchanged)
- **Node** (using the Cheerio library) to scrape the basketball data
